Styling Approach

External Stylesheet: All pages use 'style.css'.
Base Styling: Reset applied for cross-browser consistency. Typography and colour palette defined globally.
Layout: CSS Flexbox and Grid used for navigation menus, cards, and content structure.
Typography: Relative units ('rem','em') applied for scalable fonts.
Responsive Design:

Desktop → Multi-column layout with sidebars.
Tablet → Adjusted spacing and reduced columns.
Mobile → Single-column stacking with simplified navigation.
Interactive Elements: Hover, focus, and active states added to buttons and links.



Responsive Design Testing

Screenshots were taken to verify that the website adjusts correctly across multiple devices:

Desktop View (≥1200px0)
Tablet View (~768px)
Mobile View (≤480px)
